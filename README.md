#  Hi there! ( ͠▀̿ ̿ ͜ʖ ͡▀̿ ̿ )<img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px">

## I'm jair Milanes, welcome to my projects home!
### Here you can find stuff I've built in the last few years to practice and learn new tech while I have some fun.
I've been dedicated to software for the past 13+ years, and have had the opportunity to work on some cool projects 
with awesome people whom I've learned quite a bit from.

I specialize in full stack development with Javascript technologies but also have some considerable experience with 
other programing languages as well like Python, Java and PHP.

I have to confess that frontend is my personal passion, I enjoy working on clean and modern UI's, have no problem in 
trying and learning new frameworks since there are so many flavors out there, but I can code for backend just as well, 
building clean and performant API's, scripts to make live easier and integrating usefull services. I can also find my way 
around in the devops pretty well too, have an interest in learning cloud technologies and an advocate for continuous 
integration and delivery environments.

In the past few years I've have gained valuable experience in product management and team leadership working in fast 
pace Agile environments, helping groups of people evolve and mature into friendly and effective cross functional teams.

Well, that's a bit about me, if you want to know a bit more or just want to chat about tech stuff, games, family and life 
in general feel free to reach out, I'm always looking to grow my network, so hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmilanes) anytime! 

See you in around,

## Cheers!<br/><br/><br/>
